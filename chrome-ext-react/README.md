# Crave Control Chrome extension

This is an extension both to Chrome, and to Crave Control app. It communicates with back-end to send timestamps of pages that the user visits. Best used with core app for full experience of controlling crave for social medias :D.

## Technologies

Created in React and parsed using Webpack with Craco config. Pure masterpiece created in just 24 hours straight.

## How to use it?

Probably it will never see its place in Chrome extension shop, but you can test it by doing the following:
- In root directory (where the Readme lies patiently) install required packages using `npm install`.
- Then build the project using `npm run build`.
- After the build is finished open your Chrome browser and go to your extension list [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).
- Enable the Developer mode (upper-right corner), then choose "Load unpacked" and select the newly created `build` directory.
- This should result in newly added extension to Chrome browser

NOTE - You could pin the extension to have it always by your side :^)
