***BITEHACK 2024***

This year's motive was "Confronting addictions" and we came up with creating a smart **extension for Chrome** browser.
The extension allows users to set boundaries on problematic web pages such as Facebook, Instagram etc. to count the time spent on them and disallow spending more or even completely block them. Using **React(Vite + Typescript)** and **Vue** we created two fronts (whichever suits you better) to set the timers on webpages

You can check the time left when you're using the webpage without leaving it or opening extra tab thanks to our slick dynamic widget:

From technicalities it's worth mentioning that we (of course) made backend with **Django** and **MySQL** database.
